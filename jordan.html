          Clee  During the livestream o Video stream takes up most of the page
          o Background – clocks o Small control panel with Clee’s social media
          links where they can find the secondary streams – maybe just the IMM
          buttons with a different color?  After the stream o Same page layout
          as the stream o Video loops 24 hours continuously  Home Page object:
          A clock—Clee maybe sent Mitch their favorite clock? If not, ask for it
          Gelli  Deserted Island themed page – “Call-Out Island” – try having
          this title at the top  Eight memes on the page – when you click them
          they get big, like a photo gallery  Background – Sandy? Beachy?
          Watery?  Home Page object: Combine the two islands Gelli sent- use
          the single palm (or one like it) from one and the textured bottom from
          the other Jordan  Essay on a single page with lots of image/video
          references that he will send  Images should appear when designated
          <img src="images/1.png" id="jordan-image-1" /> hovered over on desktop
           Images should be embedded within the page on mobile  The essay has
          a shift halfway through – could the background and text color shift
          gradually throughout? Black text on white to white text on black? 
          Home Page object: combining black power fist with thinking man meme
          Martin  A number of video vignettes (not hosted by an outside
          platform) arranged throughout the page  Martin will send a photo
          shopped image of how he wants his page to look  Background – Martin
          will provide racist gifs/images to loop  Possibly text – Martin will
          provide it  Home Page object: TBD – he will send pngs soon – Mitch,
          you should reach out to him and remind him about this and his page
          mock-up Other pages:  Home Page – I will provide text on Friday—it
          will probably just have a couple of sentences and the title of the
          issue  Chat room  Info page – I will provide the text for this soon
          – can just be a plain-ish page – maybe with same background as home
