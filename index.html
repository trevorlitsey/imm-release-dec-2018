            IMM1: About the Artists Martin Gonzales: I’m a Chicano artist who makes work about being Chicano but only inherently, not
            intentionally. Chicano perhaps only on accident. It doesn’t seem like there is much of a way out of making Chicano art. Sometimes
            I try and meditate but end up not meditating, but that in fact is meditating… yeah…. I’m a Chicanx artist who makes Chicanx
            art which actually isn’t Chicanx art but is in fact Chicanx art…. God damn…. I get distracted so easily. What do I want people
            to know about who I am? I really struggle with this world and what is expected by our values as we get older, I’m broke as
            fuck, I just moved back into my childhood home, I’m 28, and I think ADHD is real as fuck…. Every time I make something it’s
            an attempt at trying to make sense of this confusing experience of living and thinking. What else… Oh yeah both my parents
            are Mexican or I mean, of Mexican heritage. I made this project in Mexico, I don’t know Spanish, I’m Chicanx… but I’m also
            broke. Just moved into my mom’s in Texas, and really struggle with an ADHD, depression, and anxiety mixture. So if I’m making
            work about being Chicanx, I’m also making work about all this other shit too…. This project is about making sense of the
            limiting factors identity has played in my life.

            Gelli Spinelli/@not.yr.boyfriend is a non-binary multidisciplinary artist from Minneapolis,
            MN. Their meme work can be found on Instagram as @not.yr.boyfriend, and on Facebook as Give Me Cumemes Daddy. They also contribute
            content to other meme pages, including That Gay Shit, Call Yur Sponsor Sweaty, Genderqueer Gengar, and Antifash Whiscash.
            For irl tangible art, Gelli makes pins and collars that they sell in their shop trash4posers (trash4posers.etsy.com). They
            have a rich history of underground queer performance art and event hosting at DIY spaces like Madame of the Arts and Mothership.
            Last fall, Gelli co-curated a show for Patrick's Cabaret under the moniker Baby Patè. They also run a monthly art group for
            trans and queer youth, called Ham Time. When Gelli isn’t making memes, they spend their time operating a syringe exchange,
            putting together sick looks, and mindlessly scrolling to fill the void.
