          <p>A note from Eric Larson, director of Intermediate Meme Museum:</p>
          <p>
Everyone wants to tell you or ask you what memes are, what they do. As the director of Intermediate Meme Museum, I have the privilege of diffusing those questions and answers and letting them melt into each other. Memes are fun and not fun, often at the same time. Memes do fun things and not fun things, often at the same time. They’re too articulate and anti-articulate and they’re dismissed and worshipped for this. Stuck in their ways and yet too experimental, they’re and/or and/or and/or.
          </p>

          <p>
Instead of getting lost in the muck of the What, IMM is committed to playing in the Everything Else of memes. We do not totalize. And yet IMM is not apolitical. In fact, IMM prioritizes anti-oppressive voices, ideas, and aesthetics that are not featured in the mainstream conception of the mainstream meme conversation. We’re not trying to “promote” our anomalous work to the mainstream, but rather provide a platform for the overlooked to learn from others’ overlooked-ness. To get ready.
          </p>

          <p>
We’re Minnesota-based because it’s more fun that way. There are more hidden spaces closer to the ground. We curate mostly through relationships, but always welcome the unconnected. Memes do funky things with place, and so we have chosen not to be located everywhere. All of the folks involved in IMM have tangents that point back to Minnesota.
          </p>

          <p>
The first three releases of IMM (because who knows what will happen after that) are curated around certain meme themes and dynamics unique to each release. Due to the tendency of memes and art to outgrow or evade definition only to be sucked back into a vortex of Overarching Theme, the framing that led to my curatorial decisions will be omitted from the IMM website. This way, unexpected resonances between pieces can emerge, and I can avoid committing the meme-killing act of third party deciphering. While we have Museum in our name, we are not here to capture an experience for you. Instead, we’re showing you a number of portals into things going on right now in the memeworld and elsewhere. Please be cautious and enjoy.

          <p><strong> IMM1: About the Artists </strong></p>

          <p>
            <strong>Martin Gonzales</strong>: I’m a Chicano artist who makes work about being Chicano but only inherently, not intentionally. Chicano perhaps only on accident. It doesn’t seem like there is much of a way out of making Chicano art. Sometimes I try and meditate but end up not meditating, but that in fact is meditating… yeah…. I’m a Chicanx artist who makes Chicanx art which actually isn’t Chicanx art but is in fact Chicanx art…. God damn…. I get distracted so easily. What do I want people to know about who I am? I really struggle with this world and what is expected by our values as we get older, I’m broke as fuck, I just moved back into my childhood home, I’m 28, and I think ADHD is real as fuck…. Every time I make something it’s an attempt at trying to make sense of this confusing experience of living and thinking. What else… Oh yeah both my parents are Mexican or I mean, of Mexican heritage. I made this project in Mexico, I don’t know Spanish, I’m Chicanx… but I’m also broke. Just moved into my mom’s in Texas, and really struggle with an ADHD, depression, and anxiety mixture. So if I’m making work about being Chicanx, I’m also making work about all this other shit too…. This project is about making sense of the limiting factors identity has played in my life.

            <strong>Clee McCracken</strong> (@clockluvr on Instagram) is a multidisciplinary artist. All their work is about Clocks.

          <p>
            <strong>Gelli Spinelli/@not.yr.boyfriend</strong> is a non-binary
            multidisciplinary artist from Minneapolis, MN. Their meme work can
            be found on Instagram as @not.yr.boyfriend, and on Facebook as Give
            Me Cumemes Daddy. They also contribute content to other meme pages,
            including That Gay Shit, Call Yur Sponsor Sweaty, Genderqueer
            Gengar, and Antifash Whiscash. For irl tangible art, Gelli makes
            pins and collars that they sell in their shop trash4posers
            <a href="trash4posers.etsy.com">(trash4posers.etsy.com)</a>. They have a rich history of underground
            queer performance art and event hosting at DIY spaces like Madame of
            the Arts and Mothership. Last fall, Gelli co-curated a show for
            Patrick's Cabaret under the moniker Baby Patè. They also run a
            monthly art group for trans and queer youth, called Ham Time. When
            Gelli isn’t making memes, they spend their time operating a syringe
            exchange, putting together sick looks, and mindlessly scrolling to
            fill the void.
