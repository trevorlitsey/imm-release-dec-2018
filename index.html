              A note from Eric Larson, director of Intermediate Meme Museum:
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone wants to tell you or ask you what memes are, what they
              do. As the director of Intermediate Meme Museum, I have the
              privilege of diffusing those questions and answers and letting
              them melt into each other. Memes are fun and not fun, often at the
              same time. Memes do fun things and not fun things, often at the
              same time. They’re too articulate and anti-articulate and they’re
              dismissed and worshipped for this. Stuck in their ways and yet too
              experimental, they’re and/or and/or and/or.
            </p>

            <p>
              Instead of getting lost in the muck of the What, IMM is committed
              to playing in the Everything Else of memes. We do not totalize.
              And yet IMM is not apolitical. In fact, IMM prioritizes
              anti-oppressive voices, ideas, and aesthetics that are not
              featured in the mainstream conception of the mainstream meme
              conversation. We’re not trying to “promote” our anomalous work to
              the mainstream, but rather provide a platform for the overlooked
              to learn from others’ overlooked-ness. To get ready.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’re Minnesota-based because it’s more fun that way. There are
              more hidden spaces closer to the ground. We curate mostly through
              relationships, but always welcome the unconnected. Memes do funky
              things with place, and so we have chosen not to be located
              everywhere. All of the folks involved in IMM have tangents that
              point back to Minnesota.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first three releases of IMM (because who knows what will
              happen after that) are curated around certain meme themes and
              dynamics unique to each release. Due to the tendency of memes and
              art to outgrow or evade definition only to be sucked back into a
              vortex of Overarching Theme, the framing that led to my curatorial
              decisions will be omitted from the IMM website. This way,
              unexpected resonances between pieces can emerge, and I can avoid
              committing the meme-killing act of third party deciphering. While
              we have Museum in our name, we are not here to capture an
              experience for you. Instead, we’re showing you a number of portals
              into things going on right now in the memeworld and elsewhere.
              Please be cautious and enjoy.
